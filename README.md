# PRO COLLECTION APP

This repository contains the front end application for HAP's patient reported outcome project. The App is written in Javascript based off of this excellent [starter package](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit). Read the starter docs to learn a bit more about the features and modules installed.

## Install
1. Clone Repository
2. Install yarn if needed. `brew install yarn`
3. Install dependencies `yarn install`


## Configure Database Settings

This app uses a package called [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to manage environment variables. To set up your desired database configuration, you need to replace `.envsample` with `.env` of your own. This file can be found in the root directory of the project.

## Starting Development Server

Once you have your environment variables set, run `yarn start`
